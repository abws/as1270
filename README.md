# Artificial Intelligence for the Wind Farm Layout Optimization

## **Introduction**

This project investigates intelligent optimisation techniques in computer science for the optimisation of turbines positions in large scale wind farms.

*The project is split into two main parts, namely research & experimentation and developing a software tool*.

## **Nature of Optimisation**

Some of my implementations discretise the search space and treat the optimisation as a Combinatorial Optimisation problem.

Others treat it as a Numerical Optimisation problem where the decision variables are real numbers.

### **Discretising the Wind Farm**
As a combinatorial optimisation problem, the problem can be defined as:

$ f: \{0, 1\}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ 

Building up the grid, we ...
