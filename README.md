# Artificial Intelligence for the Wind Farm Layout Optimization

## Introduction

This project investigates Artificial Intelligence techniques, especially Computational Intelligence approaches for the optimisation of turbines in large scale wind farms.

The project is split into two parts, namely research & experimentation and developing a software tool.
