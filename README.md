# Computation Intelligence for the Optimisation of Large-scale Wind Power Plants

## **Introduction**

This project investigates intelligent techniques in Computer Science for the optimisation of turbine in large-scale wind farms.

*The project is split into two main parts, namely research & experimentation and developing a software tool*.

## Algorithms

Implemented algorithms include:

1. Genetic Algorithm
2. Particle Swarm Optimisation
3. Simulated Annealing
4. Differential Evolution
5. Binary Particle Swarm Optimisation
6. Angle Moduled Differential Evolution

All algorithms are written in java and can be run in any IDE. The algorithm of choice, along with the 'api' package must be compiled. Compilation comands will differ for operating systems.

To install 3D visualisation tool:

1.`git clone https://campus.cs.le.ac.uk/gitlab/ug_project/22-23/as1270.git`

2.`cd optimise`

3.`mvn compile`

4.`mvn package`

5.`mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.as1270.optimiser.OptimiserApplication"`

6. Open your favourite web-browser and enter 'localhost:8080/optimise'
