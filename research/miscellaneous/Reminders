* Do not check security constraints for discrete formulationa: It's computationally expensive and there's no need for them since these avoided by definition *
* Make a report class for generating reports! *
* Unrestricted doubles make some errors towards the end. Not sure if this will cause an impact since the error is so tiny but be careful *
